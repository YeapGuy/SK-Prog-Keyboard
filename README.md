### Slovak (Prog)
![Slovak (Prog)](./SK-Prog.svg)

Slovak (Prog) is standard English (US) keyboard layout with added 3rd and 4th level for Slovak letters and special symbols.

## What are levels?
It simply means holding modifier key `Shift` or `AltGr` while pressing normal key. Best illustrated with picture.

### Thanks to and inspired by
*Polish programmers layout*, *Tomi Belan's Slovak (AltGr) keyboard layout* and *US-International keyboard layout*

## Windows
Created using *Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4*.

Unzip and run `setup.exe`. May require reboot. You can set the layout through windows settings.

`Caps Lock` can be easily mapped to `Alt Gr` using [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys/releases) software.

## Android
Works with [External Keyboard Helper](http://www.apedroid.com/android-applications/external-keyboard-helper).

The application needs *Storage permissions* enabled from android settings.  
Copy `ekh_backup.dat` to `Internal storage` root. In the application *EKH Settings*: **Choose keyboard layout > Custom 1 (or Custom 2)**. Then in the application: **Advanced settings > Keyboard mapping > Customize keyboard mappings > ⋮ (settings) > Restore**.
